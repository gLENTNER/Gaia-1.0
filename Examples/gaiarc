# This is an example configuration file for the GAIA application.
# Comments follow the `#` character. Blank lines are ignored. Every command
# follows the `set` keyword. Feel free to use `e` notation for numbers.
# For easy editting, try setting the syntax highlighting to that of a Shell
# script.

# See the README.md file for more information on what these all mean and what
# else can go in here!

# set bounds on the region for the system (our `box`)
set Xlimits -16863 16863 # units are the responsibility of the user!!!!!
set Ylimits -16863 16863 # this is in parsecs
set Zlimits -2e3 2e3

# this says to use the cyclindrical radius as the basis for the nearest
# neighbor statistics. Think GAIA::Vector::R()
# the number on the end says what resolution to use (how many points)
set Analysis R 1.5e+4

# if you have a spherical system, isotropic in Theta and Phi, try
# set Analysis Rho 10000

# alternatively, if there is angular structure (such as spiral arms), one
# can have the statistics determined over the XY plane, we need two numbers!
# set Analysis XY 1e3 1e3

# set some of the parameters inside here instead of at run time,
# the `=` isn't necessary in the configuration file ...
set --num-trials 1000
#set --num-trials 30    # this would be an error because it was already given!
set --num-particles 1000

# quote marks aren't necessary for file paths
set --out-path ./Output/GAIA-results

# nor do you need the leading `./`
set --pos-path Output/model

# use quote marks for paths with spaces in them though
set --tmp-path   "~/.Gaia/Temporary\ Files/tmp"

# The use of a configuration file by GAIA is on the border of necessary.
# There aren't that many parameters in here, but without an rc file, the
# user would need to input all of these arguments for every execution!
