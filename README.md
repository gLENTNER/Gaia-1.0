# Gaia

An application for building 3D numerical models of systems of particles
using a Monte Carlo rejection-sampling algorithm based on probability
density functions (PDFs) defined by the user. A nearest neighbor analysis
is performed on each of a number of trial constructions for the system.

**Dependencies:** C++11 compliant compiler, OpenMP.
